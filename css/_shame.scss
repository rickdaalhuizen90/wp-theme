/**
The _shame.scss file is to be used only for bad code that really shouldn't be
put in any other file. Using it is not recommended but is sometimes necessary.

When writing a rule in the shame file, ALWAYS put a comment above it stating
specifically why it was written, and what problem it solved.
Don't be afraid to write multiple lines to explain it.
